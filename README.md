## StelsoMphiri-Cybersecurity_Portfolio
I am Stelso Mphiri. I am a computer science student and cybersecurity enthuiast, passionate about technology and cybersecurity

During my journey in this field, I have honed my technical expertise through hands-on labs on platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and Let'sDefend. I have also earned certifications such as CompTIA Security+ and Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, which have solidified my knowledge of security frameworks, intrusion detection, and incident response.

In addition to my technical background, I have engaged in collaborative and leadership opportunities, such as completing hands-on labs on Letâ€™sDefend, which simulate real-world scenarios faced by Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts. These labs have strengthened my skills in threat detection, log analysis, incident response, and threat hunting. By working through these scenarios, I have gained practical experience in responding to cyber threats effectively and efficiently. These experiences have also equipped me with strong problem-solving skills, analytical thinking, and a can-do attitude that I apply to every task I undertake.

My ultimate goal is to pursue a career as a Cybersecurity Analyst/ SOC Analyst, where I can leverage my skills to address emerging threats and contribute to secure digital environments.
